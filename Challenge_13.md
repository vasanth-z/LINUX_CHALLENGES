# üéØ Challenge 13: Tar Archiving and Compression

## üß† Objective:
Learn to use the `tar` command to bundle multiple files and directories into a single archive, and optionally compress that archive. This is essential for creating backups, sharing large sets of files, and moving data between systems.

## Explanation:
The file extension `.tar.gz` is actually a combination of two different technologies used in a specific sequence.

"tar" Full Form: Tape Archive

Usage: The tar command's original purpose was to create archives for backing up data to magnetic tape. Today, its main usage is to bundle multiple files and directories into a single file. It's an archiver, not a compressor.

Key Function: It gathers a collection of files and directories into a single `.tar` file while preserving their metadata, such as file permissions, ownership, and timestamps. Think of it like putting all your documents into a single box.

"gz" Full Form: GNU Zip

Usage: The gzip command's purpose is to compress a single file to make it smaller. It's a compressor, not an archiver.

Key Function: It uses a compression algorithm to reduce the file size.

The Combined Usage: `.tar.gz`
Since tar only archives and gzip only compresses a single file, they are often used together to achieve both functions at once.

The process is:

Use tar to archive a directory (e.g., my_directory) and all its contents into a single file (e.g., my_directory.tar).

Then, use gzip to compress that single my_directory.tar file, resulting in my_directory.tar.gz.

A verbose list is simply a detailed, item-by-item list of what a command is doing. It provides more information than the minimum required.

The word "verbose" means "using or expressed in more words than are needed." In Linux, a verbose output means the command talks more and tells you everything it's doing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps:

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Create a Test Directory with Files:

Create a directory named `~/archive_test` and add a couple of files.

```bash
mkdir ~/archive_test
echo "This is the first file." > ~/archive_test/file1.txt
echo "This is the second file." > ~/archive_test/file2.txt
```

### üîç Original Directory Contents (Before Archive)

```bash
ls -l ~/archive_test/
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Create a Compressed Tar Archive

Use `tar` to compress the `archive_test` directory into a `.tar.gz` file.

```bash
tar -czvf ~/my_archive.tar.gz ~/archive_test
```

<img width="615" height="87" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-05 211235" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/889d90a8-29a3-4fec-b852-2e7b8c9c6111" />


**Flags Explanation**:
- `-c`: Create a new archive
- `-z`: Compress using gzip
- `-v`: Verbose (shows progress)
- `-f`: Specifies filename of archive

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Delete the Original Directory

To verify your archive works as a backup, remove the original folder.

```bash
rm -r ~/archive_test
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Extract the Archive

Extract the contents into a new directory named `~/extracted_archive`.

```bash
mkdir ~/extracted_archive
tar -xzvf ~/my_archive.tar.gz -C ~/extracted_archive/
```

**Flags Explanation**:
- `-x`: Extract files
- `-z`: Use gzip
- `-v`: Verbose output
- `-f`: Specifies archive file
- `-C`: Destination directory for extraction

### üîç Original Directory Contents (Before Archive)

```bash
ls -l ~/archive_test/
```

---

### üóÉÔ∏è Extracted Directory Contents (After Extraction)

```bash
ls -l ~/extracted_archive/archive_test/
```

**Expected Output**:
```
total 8
-rw-rw-r-- 1 your_username your_username 24 Aug  5 14:30 file1.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 your_username your_username 25 Aug  5 14:30 file2.txt
```
