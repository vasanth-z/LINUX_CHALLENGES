# ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 16: Finding Files with Specific Criteria

**Objective:**  
Master the `find` command to locate files based on various attributes like size, modification time, and name. This is a crucial skill for system administration and file management.

---

## âœ… Steps:

### 1. Create the Test Environment:

Create a sample directory structure with files of different sizes and ages.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/project_x/data ~/project_x/config ~/project_x/logs
touch -t 202401151000 ~/project_x/data/old_data.log
dd if=/dev/zero of=~/project_x/data/large_file.bin bs=1M count=2
touch ~/project_x/config/config.txt
touch ~/project_x/config/empty.conf
echo "Example log entry" > ~/project_x/logs/service.log
```

### 2. Find Files Larger than 1 MB

Search for all files within ~/project_x that are larger than 1 megabyte.

```bash
find ~/project_x -type f -size +1M
```

ðŸ“Œ Note: -type f specifies a regular file, and -size +1M looks for files greater than 1MB.

---

### 3. Find Files Modified in the Last 24 Hours:

Find all files in ~/project_x that have been modified within the last day.

```bash
find ~/project_x -type f -mtime -1
```

----

### 4. Find All Empty Files:

Find and list all files that have a size of zero bytes.

```bash
find ~/project_x -type f -empty
```

### 5. Find All `.txt` Files:

Find all files ending with the .txt extension.

```bash
find ~/project_x -type f -name "*.txt"
```
